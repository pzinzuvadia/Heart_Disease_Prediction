# Automated-Personalized-Emailing-System
Automated system for generating email IDs from given data and sending personalized emails along with attachments
Using python, I have developed a system that can send emails automatically. It is capable of sending attachments along with the email. Features of this model are:
- Automated the task of sending emails
- Can create company-specific email IDs of employees based on the data (like first name, last name, and company name) provided.
- Sending multiple attachments
- Personalizes the subject and body of the email
- consists of an SSL security model which provides safe and secure transactions of emails
- Time-saving and effort reduction
